            Welcome to Guess the Number!                                       
            I'm going to think of a number between 1 and 100                    
            while you try and guess what it is! Remember,                       /\-/\Â 
            you cannot guess a number less than 1 or greater than 100!         (=^Y^=)
            I'll give you hints with each guess on how close you are to         (>o<)
            guessing my number. When you finally guess it, i'll tell
            you how many guesses it took! Good luck!
