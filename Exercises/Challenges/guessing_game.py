# The Challenge:
#
# Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:
#
# 1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
# 2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is
#    within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
# 3. further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
# 4. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
#    closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
# 5. farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
# 6. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First, pick a random integer from 1 to 100 using the random module and assign it to a variable

# mystery_num = random.randint(1, 100)

# Next, print an introduction to the game and explain the rules

            Welcome to Guess the Number!                                       
            I'm going to think of a number between 1 and 100                    
            while you try and guess what it is! Remember,                       /\-/\Â 
            you cannot guess a number less than 1 or greater than 100!         (=^Y^=)
            I'll give you hints with each guess on how close you are to         (>o<)
            guessing my number. When you finally guess it, i'll tell
            you how many guesses it took! Good luck!
